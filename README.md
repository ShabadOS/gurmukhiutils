# Gurmukhi Utils (Python)

A utilities library for converting, analyzing, and testing Gurmukhi strings. Ported to Python from [`gurmukhi-utils`](https://github.com/shabados/gurmukhi-utils).

## Contributing

Requirements:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (see version in `pyproject.toml`)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

Development:

- Install project dependencies with `poetry install`.
- Automatically format/lint when committing by enabling pre-commit hooks with `poetry run pre-commit install`.
- Run tests with `poetry run pytest`.

Note 1: The optional extensions in VS Code may help you.

Note 2:  If you don't enable the pre-commit hooks, please manually run the related commands in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` before submitting each and every PR.

## Todo

Beyond the obvious implementation of features from the original `gurmukhi-utils` program:

- GitHub workflows for pytest and making sure flake8/isort/black are passing on PR
- Publishing on PyPi
- Adding installation/usage docs for end-user
- Possibly consider exporting a requirements.txt via poetry for pip using contributors (not needed for end-users).
